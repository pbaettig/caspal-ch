### I am...
an experienced IT engineer with 13 years experience across a wide field of jobs and companies. For the last 6 years I have focused mainly on Cloud / DevOps on topics.<br><br>
DevOps can mean different things to different people. I view it as the literal interface between development and operations, i.e. what needs to happen for code in development to go live on production and everything afterwards to run it in a secure and stable way. It means building infra and tooling that attempts to remove the "wall" between development and operations, allowing for quick & easy deployments and troubleshooting.


### What I can help you with:
#### build infrastructure
No matter if it's for a small website (like this one) or a more complex application involving multiple (micro) services.

#### automate
Every manual process is prone to inconsistency and human error. Or at the very least it's boring and takes away time that could be better spent elsewhere. 

#### operate
There's nothing more important to the successful operation of any application than having clear metrics. A solid monitoring system not only helps to identify potential issues before they cause actual problems to your users. It also helps in retroactive analysis of incidents, troubleshooting, regression testing new releases and benchmarking.


### What I can't help you with:
I'm swiss and feel a bit uneasy writing about all the things I can help you with, so to balance it out and be transparent here are some things I likely cannot help you with

#### webdesign / frontend
As is evident by this website. The most interesting aspect of this site has been the infra setup anyway ðŸ˜…

#### Windows
I'm no trying to bash the Microsoft ecosystem, I just don't know enough about it to be particularly helpful
